I began my career as an architect in China, working on urban projects that shaped how people live and move within cities. Over time, I became increasingly interested in the broader systems behind these spaces — how planning, mobility, and policy intersect to create sustainable urban environments.

This led me to pursue a PhD at the University of Cambridge, where my research explores how data-driven mobility policy can support low-carbon lifestyle transitions. I now work across academia, government, and industry to translate research into real-world solutions for sustainable transport and urban change.
