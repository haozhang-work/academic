Sometimes, a pause in research does not mean idleness — it simply means that life has been busy in other directions.

This evening, I reopened my PhD project file. The screen lit up with a quiet reminder: “last modified: July.”
I froze for a moment. That was four months ago. Summer had just ended then; now it is already deep autumn. The days grow shorter, yet somehow this small moment felt bright.

For months, I hadn’t touched this file — not because I was standing still, but because I was doing other things: rewriting a paper, attending two academic conferences, flying back to China for a talent event, and juggling teaching, lectures, seminars, and society responsibilities.
My life has been full, just not in the narrow sense of data and models. The research was still there, quietly waiting beneath the surface.

When I opened Stata today, a message appeared: “license expired.”
I laughed — it had indeed been too long. After updating, I typed a few commands, and the data began to flow again. Variables, coefficients, regression results — everything came back to life with surprising ease.

At that moment, I felt an unexpected gratitude toward my past self — the one who, months ago, decided to reorganize everything.
I used to write messy code: inconsistent naming, unclear paths, scattered datasets. Every time I reran an analysis, it felt like defusing a bomb. One day, I realized this chaos was unsustainable. So I started over — rebuilt my data structure, rewrote every script, and enforced strict order.
Today, that effort paid off. The program ran perfectly. That was progress — not just in knowledge, but in discipline, in structure, in how I treat my own work.

Research, I realized, moves like a river — sometimes rapid, sometimes winding, sometimes still. Those quiet months weren’t wasted; they were a period of accumulation. In conferences, I absorbed new ideas; in teaching, I refined my logic; in travel and conversation, I reconnected my research with the world.
None of it was lost time — just another kind of learning.

When I reopened the file, there was no guilt or anxiety — only a calm sense of return. I am still on the path, only walking it with steadier steps.

Postscript

Research is not a straight line; it moves in waves.

A pause is not failure, but adjustment.

What matters is not that we never stop, but that we can always begin again.

The moment I reopened my file, I realized — I hadn’t gone far.

I was simply going deeper.
